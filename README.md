# Optimizing-Dijsktra-s-Algorithm-using-OpenMP
This repository contains code for optimizing Dijkstra's algorithm using OpenMP, a library that supports parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran on shared-memory architectures. By using OpenMP, we can parallelize certain parts of the algorithm to improve its performance on multi-core processors.

Prerequisites
Before running the code in this repository, you'll need to have the following software installed:

A C++ compiler that supports OpenMP (e.g. GCC, Clang)
